If so, which guild and why are you leaving?","Knights Radiants, large leveling guild with no current raiding, and I'd like to get into raiding to get a better understanding of the game and my class before Classic ends, they're definitely good people though"],["How did you hear about Sharp and Shiny, and what made you apply?","Fastest guild on the server on warcraftlogs = most likely group of people for me to learn a lot from in terms of raiding and being able to improve at playing mage in general, as well as finding out Aprikat (fellow HC streamer) is also in the guild, so I'd at least know someone :P. I ultimately want to 1. Improve at mage in terms of endgame PvE, 2. learn to clear all current-content at least once before TBC drops, and 3. to have a bunch of people i can play and chill with, as well as learn from on a consistent basis would be cool :D"],["How extensive is your organized raiding experience? The more details the better","Relatively little considering the duration the game's been out. I cleared up to Golemagg on molten core on Nost PvE (server first Garr), so I lack the knowledge of most of MC / all of BWL/AQ/Naxx etc. Did some normal raiding from cata-WoD in retail but nothing noteworthy. Due to my knowledge and ability from other areas in the game though (primarily levelling, also general mechanics) as well as previous competitive game experience (roughly top 10,000 in EU in CS:GO), I feel as if I'd be able to learn fast, and have the self-motivation to look up boss strategies/builds etc and accept+improve on any constructive criticism so i can become a better player."],["Do you have parses on warcraftlogs? If so, please provide a link.","N"],["What do you think is more important for a successful PvE progression guild: attitude or skill? Why?","Attitude as attitude leads to improving your base skill, typically in the form of hard work and being able to work with and communicate with other people, skill from natural talent (especially in a knowledge-based game like Classic) doesn't get you very far, you need the drive to learn"],["When are your usual playtimes? What occupies the bulk of your time in-game? (PvP, PvE, RP, etc.)","Can play literally whenever as my work is flexible, and the bulk of my in-game time is spent usually on levelling content typically focused around mage. I currently hold the 1-60 SSF /played record (48h), as well as the majority of 1-10 records (https://www.speedrun.com/user/Tommysalami). I also have a mage guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxMc2GoP33c), have soloed Stockades/DM(VC)/SM Lib/SM GY at appropriate levels on a mage with average gear, have 2 HC characters at 60, mage having the HC /played record of 72h (https://classichc.net/hall-of-legends/). Also 1st place in HCBR#1 and HCC#4. I'm currently working on learning all of the boost pulls (learnt ZG 11pack today), and i'm aiming to learn the ZG 22 pack, mara 300+500 and currently in the process of making one for SM:GY"],["We are on an RP-PvE server, but as a guild, we do not participate in RP.
